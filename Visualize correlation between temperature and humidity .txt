% Read temperature and humidity from a ThingSpeak channel and visualize the 
% relationship between them using the SCATTER plot 

% Channel 12397 contains data from the MathWorks Weather Station, located 
% in Natick, Massachusetts. The data is collected once every minute. Field 
% 3 contains the humidity data and field 4 contains temperature data. 

% Channel ID to read data from 
readChannelID = 1957556; 
% Temperature Field ID 
TemperatureFieldID = 1; 
% Humidity Field ID 
HumidityFieldID = 2; 

% Channel Read API Key   
% If your channel is private, then enter the read API 
% Key between the '' below:   
readAPIKey = 'O0WRXUH8T26GIRU4'; 

% Read Temperature and Humidity Data. Learn more about the THINGSPEAKREAD function by 
% going to the Documentation tab on the right side pane of this page.
